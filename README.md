### BIOL551 Independent Project - Nicole Ayala
*Discussing Some Factors Associated with an Increase in Risk and Different Symptoms of Breast Cancer*

#### __Purpose of this Project__

Everyone knows someone in their life who has been diagnosed or passed from having a type of breast cancer. Hence, in this project I wanted to focus on a couple of factors that correlate to the cause of breast cancer and investigate which of these factors impact the recurrence of breast cancer as well as at certain ages, predict what types of tumors with their particular features are the most common.


#### __What is Breast Cancer?__
Breast Cancer is an extremely common branch of cancer that mainly impacts women. This type of cancer is essentially a large mass of cell growth within the breast. The breast is an organ that contains various glands, ducts, blood vessels, lymph vessels, and fatty tissue. Most breast cancers begin in the ducts and lobules (milk-producing glands).


#### __Causes of Breast Cancer__
The primary cause of breast cancer is usually through genetically inherited mutations to specific genes, i.e. BRCA1 and BRCA2 as well as starting menopause after the age of 55 and menstruating before the age of 12 which can lead to longer exposure to estrogen and other hormones which increase the likelihood of getting diagnosed with breast cancer.

*To Reduce Breast Cancer Risk According to the CDC*
- Be physically active
- Drink alcoholic beverages in moderation
- Limit your excess hormone intake and discuss with your primary care doctor
- If pregnant, breastfeed if able to
- Learn about your familial history of any past cancer history or inherited mutations in BRCA genes4
