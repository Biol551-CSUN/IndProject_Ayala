### BIOL551 Independent Project - Nicole Ayala
*Discussing Some Factors Associated with an Increase in Risk and Different Symptoms of Breast Cancer*

#### __Purpose of this Project__

Everyone knows someone in their life who has been diagnosed or passed from having a type of breast cancer. Hence, in this project I wanted to focus on a couple of factors that correlate to the cause of breast cancer and at certain ages predict what t
types of tumors with their particular features are the most common. Most would say that the highest probability of getting diagnosed with breast cancer would have to deal with your genetics and the increased likelihood of mutations in specific genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2. However, several other conditions would also be playing a role besides genetics such as age, benign and malignant tumor severity, etc. which is what I will be investigating through this series of outputs.
